# Telugu_Chandassu
I did a mini project using python language with a team of 3 on the part of Telugu Grammar called "Chandassu.
"The'aksharaas' (syllables) are divided into 'laghuvu' ("light") and 'guruvu' ("heavy")  based on the time period of pronunciation. 
The pattern of 'laghuvu' and 'guruvu 'in a sequence of three is called Gaá¹‡am (Group). 
With the help of dictionaries and other data structures and libraries, the python program can display the ganam group.
